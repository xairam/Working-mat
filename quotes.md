>Du musst deinen Körper dem Geist unterwerfen - 

>Wenn du nicht mit der Zeit gehst, gehst du nach der Zeit.   
## Bruce Lee
>If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.   

>Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.   

>The more we value things, the less we value ourselves.   

>Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.   

>You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.
# Tesla
>Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t–you’re right.   

>Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.   

>The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.   

>Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goals.   

>Vision without execution is just hallucination.   

>When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.   

>It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.   

>Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.   

>If money is your hope for independence, you will never have it. The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience and ability.
