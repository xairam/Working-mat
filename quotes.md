>Du musst deinen Körper dem Geist unterwerfen - 

>Wenn du nicht mit der Zeit gehst, gehst du nach der Zeit.   

>If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.   

>Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.   

>The more we value things, the less we value ourselves.   

>Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.   

>You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it >becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.
